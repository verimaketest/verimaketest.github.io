I received my M.S. degree in Integrated Circuit Engineering from Fuzhou University in 2020, and the B.S. degree in Electronic Science and Technology from Southeast University Chengxian College in 2017. From 2020 to 2023, I served as a Research Assistant with VeriMake Innovation Lab, Fudan University and Southeast University, respectively. Currently, I'm under the advisement of Prof. [Bruno da Silva](https://www.etrovub.be/people/member/about-bio/bdasilva/) and pursuing the Ph.D. degree in Engineering Sciences at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel. My research interests include domain-specific architecture and reconfigurable technologies.
